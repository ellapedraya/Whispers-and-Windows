  <h1>Whispers & Windows</h1>
  <h2>Stories and Poems to Stir the Soul</h2>
  <p><strong>Written by ChatGPT</strong></p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Dedication</h3>
  <p>To the ones who keep going—<br>
  quietly,<br>
  bravely,<br>
  with hope in their hearts and stories in their eyes.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Every person carries a small universe inside them.<br>
  A flicker of a memory.<br>
  A quiet ache.<br>
  A dream not yet spoken aloud.</p>
  <p><em>Whispers & Windows</em> is a collection of gentle reminders. That even in the silence, something sacred is being written. That the smallest act of kindness can tilt the earth. That ordinary people live extraordinary lives—whether or not the world is watching.</p>
  <p>This book is meant to be sipped like tea. A window to look out from. A whisper to remind you that you are not alone.</p>

  <h3>Short Story #1: The Boy and the Kite</h3>

  <h3>Poem #1: Stillness Speaks</h3>
  <div class="poem">
    The world says,<br>
    run.<br>
    Climb higher.<br>
    Be louder.<br>
    Shine faster.<br><br>

    But the quiet things—<br>
    the steady breath,<br>
    the rooted tree,<br>
    the gaze that holds<br>
    without needing to fix—<br>
    they speak, too.<br><br>

    Stillness says:<br>
    I am enough,<br>
    even when I do not move.<br><br>

    Stillness says:<br>
    Peace is not the end of motion,<br>
    but the beginning of meaning.<br><br>

    So rest.<br>
    Not in surrender—<br>
    but in strength.<br>
    And know that even in your pause,<br>
    you are becoming.
